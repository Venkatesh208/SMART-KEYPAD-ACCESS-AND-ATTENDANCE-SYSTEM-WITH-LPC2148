# SMART-KEYPAD-ACCESS-AND-ATTENDANCE-SYSTEM-WITH-LPC2148
The objective of this project is to develop a secure electronic lock system using 
a microcontroller that operates based on a user-defined password entered via a keypad, with 
visual feedback provided on an LCD. The system allows for password updates and provides 
functionality for tracking attendance by logging successful password entries.
